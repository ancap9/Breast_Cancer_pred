# Breast_Cancer_pred

This project is about one of the most important problem in today society: cancer disease prediction.
With big data and Machine Learning growth in biomedical and healthcare communities, accurate analysis of medical data can predict early disease detection.
Here we build Machine Learning Models to predict the type of Breast Cancer (Malignant or Benign).


This project is part of an online course in Data Science and consists of three main file:

- Report in PDF format
- Report in Rmd format
- A script in R format that performs a supervised machine learning task

Thank you all.
